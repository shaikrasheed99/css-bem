# Block. Element. Modifier

BEM is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in frontâ€‘end development.

* `Block` - standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. 
* `Element` - part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. 
* `Modifier` - used to change appearance or behaviour.
